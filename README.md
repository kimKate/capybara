**Description**

This repo contains tests for the page with capybara testing framework testing

I was informed that the task must be solved on ruby or python, but due to the lack of time i had to realise tests using js framework. 
Actually I have a draft of tests using capubara - but i'm struggling with building errors.

But the structure is quite familiar.

**Launching tests**

To open the project you need to have node.js installed

```
npm install cypress --save-dev
```

```
npx cypress open
```

I think that's all you need to have to launch the tests.
If you have any questions feel free to ask me)
